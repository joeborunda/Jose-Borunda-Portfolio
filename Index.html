        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I am developer that started out as a tecnical writer for software companies.</p>
          <p>As a technical documentation writer, I have worked with three different software companies. I started with an
          Atlanta-based company, Livevox. With them, I worked con call distribution software. I created user guides, release
          notes, and API documentation. I moved on to an e-commerce company, Yalo. With them, I worked on internal and
          client-facing documentation, developing the entire documentation platform. My latest experience is with a San
          Francisco-based company, Included Health. With them, I developed their Engineering Handbook. This is the largest and
          most complex project I have worked with. This was done in the docs as code style, using Github as the repository. With
          Included Health, I worked on GraphQL documentation as well, providing definitions for the federated schema.
          
          I have also created tutorial videos on how to create quality documentation. With a bit of fun and seriousness, I have
          promoted better documentation for my colleagues.
          
          My proudest moment has been with Yalo, developing all client-facing documentation. I provided the bridge between
          software engineers and the client. Ultimately, displaying the resources to use the companyâ€™s product. The documentation
          still exists and is readily available to anyone.
